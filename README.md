# Weather Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains the code and resources related to my bachelor thesis on weather classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The aim of this thesis is to explore the application of CNNs in accurately classifying weather images and understanding the potential of machine learning algorithms in real-world scenarios.

## Introduction

The field of machine learning and computer vision has rapidly advanced in recent years, becoming increasingly relevant in our daily lives. This thesis focuses on weather classification as it addresses the recurring disastrous events caused by adverse weather conditions globally. Weather classification is also important for daily activities, as accurate weather prediction enables us to adjust accordingly to changing weather patterns.

The main research questions addressed in this thesis are:

1. Can machine learning algorithms accurately classify weather images in real-world scenarios?
2. How accurate can the model be in weather classification?

To answer these questions, relevant work and theory are discussed, followed by multiple hands-on experiments to develop and improve weather classification models.
